The _Open Source BGP Configuration Labs_ project contains a series of simple configuration exercises that will help you master the intricacies of Border Gateway Protocol, the (routing) glue that holds The Internet together.

You can run the labs on virtual network devices (recommended) or on physical gear, and you can use them on almost two dozen platforms from a dozen different networking vendors.
