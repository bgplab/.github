The _Open Source Networking Configuration Labs_ projects contains series of configuration exercises that will help you master the intricacies of Border Gateway Protocol, the (routing) glue that holds The Internet together, and IS-IS, an interesting alternative to OSPF.

You can run the labs on virtual network devices (recommended) or on physical gear, and you can use them on almost two dozen platforms from a dozen different networking vendors.
